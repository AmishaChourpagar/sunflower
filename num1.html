        <img src="https://www.flowerpicturegallery.com/d/542-1/pretty+sunflower.jpg" align="right" width="300px"> 
        <p>Sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is a living annual plant in the family Asteraceae, with a large flower head (capitulum). The stem of the flower can grow up to 3 metres tall, with a flower head that can be 30 cm wide. Other types of sunflowers include the California Royal Sunflower, which has a burgundy (red + purple) flower head.

            The flower head is actually an inflorescence made of hundreds or thousands of tiny flowers called florets. The central florets look like the centre of a normal flower, apseudanthium. The benefit to the plant is that it is very easily seen by the insects and birds which pollinate it, and it produces thousands of seeds.
            
            The sunflower is the state flower of Kansas. That is why Kansas is sometimes called the Sunflower State. To grow well, sunflowers need full sun. They grow best in fertile, wet, well-drained soil with a lot of mulch. In commercial planting, seeds are planted 45 cm (1.5 ft) apart and 2.5 cm (1 in) deep.</p>

                <h3>History of Sunflower</h3>
                <p>
                    The development of the commercial sunflower has been a multi-national effort spanning continents and thousands of years. The sunflower is native to North America and was first grown as a crop by indigenous tribes over 4,500 years ago.
                    Native Americans cultivated the sunflower from its original bushy, multi-headed type to produce a single-stemmed plant bearing a large flower.

                    The crop’s multiple uses included milling for flour or meal production to make bread and cakes. Seeds were roasted, cracked and eaten whole, either as a snack or mixed with other grains, nuts and pulses into a type of granola.
                    The early Americans also discovered that sunflower oil could be extracted and used for cooking.

                    Aside from the crop’s value as a food, archaeologists have shown sunflower had a variety of non-food uses.
                    
                    The sunflower’s oils and pigments were used as a sunscreen or the basis for a purple dye for skin, hair or textile decoration, while the plant’s sturdy, fibrous stem was exploited in construction.
                    
                    The sunflower continued as a staple within North America for about 4,000 years until it was discovered by European explorers in 1510. Spanish sailors were the first to gather up large quantities of sunflower seed and ship it back to Europe.  
                    
                    But for the next 200 years, Europeans overlooked the food and oil-bearing potential of sunflowers. Instead the exotic-looking flowers became widespread across Western Europe as an ornamental or, to a lesser degree, medicinally as an anti-inflammatory.
                    
                    Sunflower growing developed throughout the 1700s and had spread across Europe into Russia and Ukraine by the turn of the 19th century.

                <h4>Facts about Sunflower</h4>
            <p style="vertical-align: left: ;">
        
               Each sunflower is actually thousands of teeny flowers.
        <br>
                The blossom of the sunflower is called a head. The yellow petals and
                fuzzy brown centers are actually individual flowers themselves.
                <br>
                 As
                many as 2,000 can make up the sunflower bloom. The petals we see on
                the outside of the bloom are called ray florets. The centers of the bloom are called disc
                florets, this is where the seeds develop.
        <br>
                Each sunflower can contain as many as 1,000 to 2,000 seeds. Sunflower
                seeds develop in the middle section of the flower called the ovary. Sunflower seeds are
                used to grow the flowers but they are also used as food for birds and humans. You can
                harvest and roast them for a healthy snack.
        <br>
                There are two types of sunflower seeds. Oilseed and non-Oilseed.
                Oilseeds are used for bird food and can also be crushed and squeezed to get the oil out.
                This process is called “extraction”. Sunflower oil can be used for cooking, skin care for
                humans, and is even used to produce some medicines.
        <br>
                Non-oilseeds are for humans to eat. The most common way to eat them is to roast them
                with a little bit of salt.
        <br>
                Sunflowers are native to North America. Like potatoes, tomatoes, and corn,
                sunflowers were first grown in North America over 5000 years ago.
                There are about 70 species of sunflowers. Their scientific name
                is Helianthus (which comes from the Greek words for "sun" and "flower"). Sunflowers can
                be different shapes, and some can be tall while others are short. The shortest sunflowers
                are called dwarfs and usually grow in clusters. Sunflowers can even be different colors.
                Yellow is the most common but there are also red, orange and purple sunflowers.
                The tallest sunflower on record was over 30 feet tall.
                <br>
                 In the summer of
                2014, the tallest sunflower ever recorded was grown in Germany and measured 30 feet, 1
                inch. This was confirmed by Guinness World Records on August, 28 2014.
        <br>
        
                Sunflowers track the sun. The French word for sunflower is “tournesol” which
                means turns with the sun. Young sunflowers track the sun, which is referred to as
                heliotropism. At sunrise, the flower buds and young blossoms will face east and follow
                the sun during the day. At sunset, the bloom will be facing the west.

    <h5>Mythological story of Sunflower</h5>
    <p>In Greek mythology, the story goes that a nymph named Clytie was in love with Apollo, the God of Sun. In the beginning, he loved her too, but then his head was turned toward another nymph. In a fit of jealous rage, Clytie told the other nymphs father, who then buried his daughter alive as punishment. Pretty brutal! Apollo was so angry that he then turned Clytie into a sunflower. But, as her love for him was so strong, she watched him move across the sky every day, just how sunflowers follow the sun.</p>

                    “Because somehow, the sun rises each day. Emerging from the horizon, brighter and more beautiful than the previous day. You'll rise from the horizon too, learning to trust again. Learning to love again. Learning to heal. You'll emerge so bright that the haters will be blinded. And darling, you'll be the sun then, bright and beautiful, but they won't be your sunflowers.”
